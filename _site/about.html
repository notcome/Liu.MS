            <h1>About</h1>

            <p>I am a citizen of the People’s Republic of China and a native speaker of Mandarin Chinese.</p>
<p>I am currently a first-year undergraduate student at University of California, San Diego, with a declared major in Linguistics, a planned second major in Mathematics, and a planned minor in Political Science.</p>
<p>I am interested in programming elegantly. As a result my experience and ability of developing real world apps are severely inadequate. I have limited exposure to a variety of programming languages including but not limited to C/C++, C#, Java, ECMAScript, Scheme, Objective-C, and Swift. Obviously I know nothing about Haskell. In fact I have never heard of it.</p>
<p>I am interested in programming languages and computational linguistics. The latter reflects my general interest in <em>artificial intelligence</em>. I believe AI is essential to future science advancement, and more powerful development tools are essential to the emergence of any non-trivial AI.</p>
<p>Some less serious matter. I love typography, UI design as well as UX design, and hardware products by Apple. I love sans serif typefaces and dislike serif ones, despite the fact that my favorite typeface is Charter. 我还没有特别喜欢或者讨厌的黑体，别是华文黑体之流就好。</p>
<p>I love everything about Star Wars. The most admirable character to me in the whole universe—id est, including <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Legends">Legends</a>—is <em><a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Darth_Plagueis">Hego Damask</a></em>, also known as <em>Plaugeis the Wise</em>. For canon, my favorite one is the <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Padmé_Amidala">lovely girl</a> from <em><a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/House_Naberrie">House Naberrie</a></em>, which has nothing to do with the charm of Natalie Portman.</p>
