<p>This is my second essay of POLI 110A, a class on political thoughts from ancient Greece to early Christianity. This essay is about Plato’s works discussed in class, in particular <em>Republic</em>. The prompt I choose from the three given by the professor, is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Philosophy seems to occupy a special place in the <em>Republic</em>, concerned with both wisdom and knowledge. What is the role of philosophy, and how does it contribute to making the “soul” just? Does it have a similar role in the <em>Apology</em> and <em>Crito</em>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason I choose to make the essay public while working on it is to create a fake image of supervision as a way against my endless procrastination. A formal discussion on this motivation will probably be given next month.</p>
<p>Prior to November 25th, any comments or advices on this essay are not encouraged for academic integrity reasons.</p>
<hr />
<p>Target: 2000 words overall, 1800 words on this essay itself.</p>
