\title{POLI 110A}

POLI 110A is a political science course I take in fall 2015 at UCSD. It’s a
class on political thoughts from ancient Greece to early Christianity. I take
this course to improve my reading and writing ability and practice my
self-discipline\refSideNote{@poliSelfDiscipline}.

\local{@poliSelfDiscipline}{@mkSideNote{Classes like this typically require me
to read a lot of materials without checking my progress in real time. It
requires a high degree of self-control to successfully handle such classes.}}

Published of this project include three essays of this course, one of which is
the final in-class exam. I may no longer agree with points made in these essays.
