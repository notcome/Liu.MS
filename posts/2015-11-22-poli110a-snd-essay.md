title: POLI 110A, Second Essay
---

This is my second essay of POLI 110A, a class on political thoughts from ancient Greece to early Christianity. This essay is about Plato’s works discussed in class, in particular _Republic_. The prompt I choose from the three given by the professor, is:

> How can the form of a city and the form of a soul be linked? How does Plato link changes in the form or organization of a city with changes in the form or organization of the soul? Is Plato also implying that any change in the just city or soul always leads to injustice?

The reason I choose to make the essay public while working on it is to create a fake image of supervision as a way against my endless procrastination. A formal discussion on this motivation will probably be given next month.

Prior to November 25th, any comments or advices on this essay are not encouraged for academic integrity reasons.

Target: 2200 words overall, 2000 words on this essay itself.

In Book II of Republic, Socrates proposed that in order to find the justice of a man one should first find the justice of a whole city because the later is larger and therefore easier to find. After finding a city’s justice, the rest effort lies at observing the similarity between a man and a city.[^368e] 

There are three parts in a soul, as there are three classes in a city.[^439a – 441c]
