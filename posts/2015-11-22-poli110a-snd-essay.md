title: POLI 110A, Second Essay
---

This is my second essay of POLI 110A, a class on political thoughts from ancient Greece to early Christianity. This essay is about Plato’s works discussed in class, in particular _Republic_. The prompt I choose from the three given by the professor, is:

> Philosophy seems to occupy a special place in the _Republic_, concerned with both wisdom and knowledge.  What is the role of philosophy, and how does it contribute to making the “soul” just? Does it have a similar role in the _Apology_ and _Crito_?

The reason I choose to make the essay public while working on it is to create a fake image of supervision as a way against my endless procrastination. A formal discussion on this motivation will probably be given next month.

Prior to November 25th, any comments or advices on this essay are not encouraged for academic integrity reasons.

Target: 2000 words overall, 1800 words on this essay itself.
