title: POLI 110A, Second Essay
---

This is my second essay of POLI 110A, a class on political thoughts from ancient Greece to early Christianity. This essay is about Plato’s works discussed in class, in particular _Republic_. The prompt I choose from the three given by the professor, is:

> How can the form of a city and the form of a soul be linked? How does Plato link changes in the form or organization of a city with changes in the form or organization of the soul? Is Plato also implying that any change in the just city or soul always leads to injustice?

The reason I choose to make the essay public while working on it is to create a fake image of supervision as a way against my endless procrastination. A formal discussion on this motivation will probably be given next month.

Prior to November 25th, any comments or advices on this essay are not encouraged for academic integrity reasons.

Target: 2200 words overall, 2000 words on this essay itself.

In Book II of _Republic_, Socrates proposed that in order to find the justice of a man one should first find the justice of a whole city because the later is larger and therefore easier to find. After finding a city’s justice, the rest effort lies at observing the similarity between a man and a city.[^368e]

Then, an ideal city is constructed by adding the necessary part step by step. First, a city requires ordinary men to farm, to craft, to maintain the material life inside the city[^369a – 371c]. Second, a city requires guardians to maintain its security from outside threats. The reason of separating guardians from craftsmen is that in an ideal city one citizen should only specialize in one field for maximum efficiency[^370c] and that warfare itself is a profession[^374b].

Next, taken for granted, Socrates said that such a city always needs an overseer, or ruler, to preserve its constitution[^412a], but he did discuss in depth the responsibility and eligibility of rulers. A ruler should be a judge who rules other souls with his own just soul[^409a]. Therefore, a ruler should be old: at his childhood he must be isolated from injustice, as at that time he could be very easily deceived[^409b]; but late in his life he should learn injustice to be able to deal with them properly, and since he had already built just models such unjust behaviors wouldn’t affect his own soul[^409c]. Rulers should be chosen from guardians, as, in spite their capability, they must devote themselves to the services of the whole city—as Socrates argued in Book I—and guardians are the one best at loving their city[^412c – d]. Hence the three classes of an ideal city are created: rulers who are the best of guardians, auxiliaries who help the rulers to maintain the security and order of the city, and the rest craftsmen.

After establishing the three classes of a city, Socrates and his fellows discussed justice inside the city, which is each class concentrates on its own work[^433b]. Subsequently, he asserted that their exists three parts in a soul, each linked to a class in the city[^439a – 441c]. The lowest part, the appetitive part of a soul which drives a person to respond to thirst, hunger, desire to money and sex—“the so-called pleasures of the body”—is the craftsmen class of a city[^442b]. The intermediate one is the spirited part and is similar to the auxiliary guardians[^441e]. The highest part, corresponding to the ruler class, is the rational part of a soul, capable of rational calculation[^441e]. The spirited part is allied with the rational part. For example, when one's appetite is in contrary to his rational calculation—like reading _Republic_ versus going to parties—after repetitively forcing himself to do the “right” rational thing, one will often get very angry at himself[^440b].

The above paragraphs state the ideal city and its corresponding just man, as well as how the organization or form of such a city is linked with the form of one’s soul. In Book VIII, Plato discusses changes in the organization of a city and their reflections in human beings. There are, according to his theories, four types of inferior cities[^544c]. From the least worse to the most worse, they are _timocracy_, _oligarchy_, _democracy, and tyranny_.





Judge/rulers must be old[^409b]

Guardians must have right education[^416b]
