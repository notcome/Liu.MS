I am currently a first-year undergraduate student at University of California,
San Diego. You could reach me through a variety of ways.

## E-mail
I own the domain name [liu.ms](http://liu.ms), which is a combination of my
family name “liu”「刘」and my given name "min sheng"「闽晟」. Practically, any
address at this domain should reach my mailbox, but I prefer the following two
addresses to be used:

- ``lambda`` at this domain, for all computer science/programming related
things.
- ``i`` at this domain, for all personal things.
- ``hi`` at this domain, for general things.

If you think you are __not very close to me__, please use the third address.

Alternatively, you can always reach me using the email arranged by UCSD, which
is ``minsheng`` at you know where.

## Online Services
I currently use:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/notcome)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Selveskii)
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/minsheng/)
- [知乎](http://www.zhihu.com/people/liu-ms)

Over the last few years I have been actively using nicknames ``selveskii`` and
``notcome``, so if you see these two names online, it's probably me.
