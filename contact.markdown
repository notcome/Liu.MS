I am currently a first-year undergraduate student at University of California,
San Diego. You could reach me through a variety of ways.

## E-mail
I own this domain name [liu.ms](http://liu.ms) a combination of my family name
_liu_「刘」and my given name _min sheng_「闽晟」. Practically, any address at this
domain should reach my mailbox, but I prefer people choosing to the following
addresses based on the accompanying descriptions:

- ``lambda`` at this domain, for all computer science/programming related
things.
- ``i`` at this domain, for all personal things.
- ``hi`` at this domain, for general things.

Note that the second address is reserved to my friends and family.

Alternatively, you can always reach me using the address arranged by UCSD, which
is ``minsheng`` at you know where.

## Online Services
I currently use:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/notcome)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Selveskii)
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/minsheng/)
- [知乎](http://www.zhihu.com/people/liu-ms)

Over the last few years I have been actively using nicknames ``selveskii`` and
``notcome``, so if you see these two names online, it's probably me.
