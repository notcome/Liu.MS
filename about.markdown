title: About
---

I am a citizen of the People’s Republic of China and a native speaker of
Mandarin Chinese.

I am currently a first-year undergraduate student at University of California,
San Diego, with a declared major in Linguistics, a planned second major in
Mathematics, and a planned minor in Political Science.

I am interested in programming elegantly. As a result my experience and ability
of developing real world apps are severely inadequate. I have limited exposure
to a variety of programming languages including but not limited to C/C++, C#,
Java, ECMAScript, Scheme, Objective-C, and Swift. Obviously I know nothing about
Haskell. In fact I have never heard of it.

I am interested in programming languages and computational linguistics. The
latter reflects my general interest in _artificial intelligence_. I believe AI
is essential to future science advancement, and more powerful development tools
are essential to the emergence of any non-trivial AI.

Some less serious matter. I love typography, UI design as well as UX design, and
hardware products by Apple. I love sans serif typefaces and dislike serif ones,
despite the fact that my favorite typeface is Charter.
我还没有特别喜欢或者讨厌的黑体，别是华文黑体之流就好。

I love everything about Star Wars. The most admirable character to me in the
whole universe—id est, including [Legends]—is _[Hego Damask]_, also known as
_Plaugeis the Wise_. For canon, my favorite one is the [lovely girl] from
_[House Naberrie]_, which has nothing to do with the charm of Natalie Portman.
